# Weather-Forecaster
Weather forecasts from various cities, compiled in a neat little website.

Just search for the city you want in the search box, then press the button to display a bunch of info on the current weather alongside the weather to expect in the next five days down below!

Search history also available for the indecisive tourist.

Known issues: there is no means to check the UV values... not with the free version of the API I'm using, anyway.
